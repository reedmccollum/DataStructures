# DataStructures
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The project required a usable C++ program that would read a .csv file into a data structure that could be sorted and printed, as well as access specified entries.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  My approach was to use a data structure that would be traversed quickly and sortable. This would allow for quick runtimes.
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  My main roadblock was the idea of data structures' abstract entries and how to establish them. The main solution for understanding them was research and practice.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I have a much better grasp on data structures and their impact on runtime efficiency.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I found myself making several more functions to avoid reusing lines of code.
